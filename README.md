# Introduction
This is a simple game built using ClojureScript by forking the
ClojureScript One framework.

The bulk of the action happens inside
* src/app/cljs/one/sample/animation.cljs

The last function /initialize-views/ does all the setup.

# Starting it

There is a pre-compiled version inside the public/ directory. You may
however also run it by calling
   script/deps
   script/run
